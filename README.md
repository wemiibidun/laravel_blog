# Laravel CRUD Blog
This is a laravel CRUD blog that I worked on as a personal project during my internship with Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan. The aim behind this project was to familiarize myself with PHP and in particular, Laravel framework.

## Introduction
The laravel blog is a CRUD website that allows users to create, read, delete and update a blogsite. The user has to be logged (User Authentication was put in place) before any of these operations can be performed.
